This project uses the ASP.NET and the MVC framework.

It loads records from a CSV file which contain information about COVID-19 cases. The records are added to a list and displayed to the user.
The user can create, read, update, and delete records, as well as export the modified list to a new CSV file.

The list can be sorted by a selected field of the record objects, and further sorted by a second field.
